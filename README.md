# FTL Savescumming Tool 0.85
Use this to backup your FTL save when you exit Faster Than Light, and to restore saves when you need them. This won't fix your savescumming conscience though.

## Installation/Usage
Make sure it is chmodded as executable, then just run it in the terminal (./ftlsav.sh). It has a curses-based menu interface.

## Support
* Windows/Cygwin (untested, probably doesn't work)
* OS X (tested, works for sure)
* Linux (untested, probably works)

## Changelog
* 0.85: Messed up, missed `continue.sav` which is where the actual continue data is stored. Now integrated.
