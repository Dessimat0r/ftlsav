=== FTL Savescumming Tool 0.8 ===
Use this to backup your FTL save when you exit Faster Than Light, and to restore saves when you need them. This won't fix your savescumming conscience though.

== Usage ==
Just run it, in the console (./ftlsav.sh). It has a menu interface in the terminal.

== Support ==
* Windows/Cygwin (untested, probably doesn't work)
* OS X (tested, works for sure)
* Linux (untested, probably works)
